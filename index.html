                <h1>Early Life</h1>
                <p>Babbage's birthplace is disputed, but according to the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. He
                    was most likely born at 44 Crosby Row, Walworth Road, London, England. A blue plaque on the junction
                    of Larcom Street and Walworth Road commemorates the event.</p>
                <p>His date of birth was given in his obituary in The Times as 26 December 1792; but then a nephew wrote
                    to stay that Babbage was born one year earlier, in 1791. The parish register of St. Mary's,
                    Newington, Londin, shows that Babbage was baptised on 6th January 1792, supporting a birth year of
                    1791.</p>
                <p>Babbage was one of four children of Benjamin Babbage and Betsy Plumleigh Teape. His father was a
                    banking partner of William Praed in founding Praed's & Co. of Fleet Street, London, in 1801. In
                    1801, the Babbage family moved into the old Rowdens house in East teignmouth. Around the age of
                    eight, Babbage was sent to a country school in Alphingyton near Exeter to recover from a
                    life-threatening fever. For a short time, he attended King Edward VI Grammer School in Totnes, South
                    Devon, but his health forced him back to private tutors for a time.</p>
                <p>Babbage then joined the 30-student Holmwood Academy, in Baker Street, Enfield, Middlesex, under the
                    Reverned Stephen Freeman. The academy had a library that promoted Babbage's love of mathematics. He
                    studied with two more private tutors after leaving the academy. The first was a clergyman near
                    Cambridge; through him Babbage encountered Charles Simeon and his evangelical followers, but the
                    tution was not what he needed. He was brought home, to study at the Totness school: this was at age
                    16 or 17. The second was an Oxford tutor, under whom Babbage reached a level in Classics sufficient
                    to be accepted by the University of Cambridge.</p>

            <div class="college">
                <h1>At the University of Cambridge </h1>
                <p>Babbage arrived at Trinity College, Cambridge, in October 1810. He was already self-taught in some
                    parts of contemporary mathematics. He had read Robert Woodhouse, Joseph Louis Lagrange, and Marie
                    Agnesi. As a result, he was disappointed in the standard mathematical instruction available at the
                    university.</p>
                <p>Babbage, John Herschel, George Peacock, and several other friends formed the Analytical Society in
                    1812, they were also close to Edward Ryan. As a student, Babbage was also a member of other
                    societies such as The Ghost Club, concerned with investigating supernatural phenomena, and the
                    Extractors Club, dedicated to liberating its members from the madhouse, should any be committed to
                    one.</p>
                <p>In 1812, Babbage transferred to Peterhouse, Cambridge. He was the top mathematician there,but did not
                    graduate with honours. He instead received a degree without examination in 1814. He had defended a
                    thesis that was considered blasohemous in the preliminary public disputation, but it is not known
                    whether this fact is related to his not sitting the examination.</p>

            <div class="after-college">
                <h1>After Cambridge</h1>
                <p>Considering his reputation, Babbage quickly made progress. He lectured to the Royal Institution on
                    astronomy in 1815, and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1816. After graduation, on the
                    other hand, he applied for positions unsuccessfully, and had little in the way of a career. In 1816
                    he was a candidate for a teaching job at Haileybury College; he had recommendations from James Ivory
                    and John Playfair, but lost out to Henry Walter. In 1819, Babbage and Herschel visited Paris and the
                    Society of Arcueil, meeting leading French mathematicians and physicists. That year Babbage applied
                    to be professor at the University of Edinburgh, with the recommendation of Pierre Simon Laplace; the
                    post went to William Wallace.</p>

                <p>With Herschel, Babbage worked on the electrodynamics of Arago's rotations, publishing in 1825. Their
                    explanations were only transitional, being picked up and broadened by Michael Faraday. The phenomena
                    are now part of the theory of eddy currents, and Babbage and Herschel missed some of the clues to
                    unification of electromagnetic theory, staying close to Ampère's force law.</p>

                <p>Babbage purchased the actuarial tables of George Barrett, who died in 1821 leaving unpublished work,
                    and surveyed the field in 1826 in Comparative View of the Various Institutions for the Assurance of
                    Lives. This interest followed a project to set up an insurance company, prompted by Francis Baily
                    and mooted in 1824, but not carried out. Babbage did calculate actuarial tables for that scheme,
                    using Equitable Society mortality data from 1762 onwards.</p>

                <p>During this whole period, Babbage depended awkwardly on his father's support, given his father's
                    attitude to his early marriage, of 1814: he and Edward Ryan wedded the Whitmore sisters. He made a
                    home in Marylebone in London and established a large family. On his father's death in 1827, Babbage
                    inherited a large estate (value around £100,000, equivalent to £9.21 million or $12.6 million
                    today), making him independently wealthy. After his wife's death in the same year he spent time
                    travelling. In Italy he met Leopold II, Grand Duke of Tuscany, foreshadowing a later visit to
                    Piedmont. In April 1828 he was in Rome, and relying on Herschel to manage the difference engine
                    project, when he heard that he had become a professor at Cambridge, a position he had three times
                    failed to obtain (in 1820, 1823 and 1826).</p>

                <div class="royal-society">
                    <h2>Royal Astronomical Society</h2>

                    <p>Babbage was instrumental in founding the Royal Astronomical Society in 1820, initially known as
                        the Astronomical Society of London. Its original aims were to reduce astronomical calculations
                        to a more standard form, and to circulate data. These directions were closely connected with
                        Babbage's ideas on computation, and in 1824 he won its Gold Medal, cited "for his invention of
                        an engine for calculating mathematical and astronomical tables".</p>

                    <p>Babbage's motivation to overcome errors in tables by mechanisation had been a commonplace since
                        Dionysius Lardner wrote about it in 1834 in the Edinburgh Review (under Babbage's guidance). The
                        context of these developments is still debated. Babbage's own account of the origin of the
                        difference engine begins with the Astronomical Society's wish to improve The Nautical Almanac.
                        Babbage and Herschel were asked to oversee a trial project, to recalculate some part of those
                        tables. With the results to hand, discrepancies were found. This was in 1821 or 1822, and was
                        the occasion on which Babbage formulated his idea for mechanical computation. The issue of the
                        Nautical Almanac is now described as a legacy of a polarisation in British science caused by
                        attitudes to Sir Joseph Banks, who had died in 1820.
                    </p>

                    <p>Babbage studied the requirements to establish a modern postal system, with his friend Thomas
                        Frederick Colby, concluding there should be a uniform rate that was put into effect with the
                        introduction of the Uniform Fourpenny Post supplanted by the Uniform Penny Post in 1839 and
                        1840. Colby was another of the founding group of the Society. He was also in charge of the
                        Survey of Ireland. Herschel and Babbage were present at a celebrated operation of that survey,
                        the remeasuring of the Lough Foyle baseline.</p>

                <div class="british-school">
                    <h2>British Lagrangian School</h2>

                    <p>The Analytical Society had initially been no more than an undergraduate provocation. During this
                        period it had some more substantial achievements. In 1816 Babbage, Herschel and Peacock
                        published a translation from French of the lectures of Sylvestre Lacroix, which was then the
                        state-of-the-art calculus textbook.</p>

                    <p>Reference to Lagrange in calculus terms marks out the application of what are now called formal
                        power series. British mathematicians had used them from about 1730 to 1760. As re-introduced,
                        they were not simply applied as notations in differential calculus. They opened up the fields of
                        functional equations (including the difference equations fundamental to the difference engine)
                        and operator (D-module) methods for differential equations. The analogy of difference and
                        differential equations was notationally changing Δ to D, as a "finite" difference becomes
                        "infinitesimal". These symbolic directions became popular, as operational calculus, and pushed
                        to the point of diminishing returns. The Cauchy concept of limit was kept at bay. Woodhouse had
                        already founded this second "British Lagrangian School" with its treatment of Taylor series as
                        formal.</p>

                    <p>In this context function composition is complicated to express, because the chain rule is not
                        simply applied to second and higher derivatives. This matter was known to Woodhouse by 1803, who
                        took from Louis François Antoine Arbogast what is now called Faà di Bruno's formula. In essence
                        it was known to Abraham De Moivre (1697). Herschel found the method impressive, Babbage knew of
                        it, and it was later noted by Ada Lovelace as compatible with the analytical engine. In the
                        period to 1820 Babbage worked intensively on functional equations in general, and resisted both
                        conventional finite differences and Arbogast's approach (in which Δ and D were related by the
                        simple additive case of the exponential map). But via Herschel he was influenced by Arbogast's
                        ideas in the matter of iteration, i.e. composing a function with itself, possibly many times.
                        Writing in a major paper on functional equations in the Philosophical Transactions (1815/6),
                        Babbage said his starting point was work of Gaspard Monge.</p>
